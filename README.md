- Cluster the general population into meaningful demographic segments.
- Compare customer data against these segments to identify which groups are most representative.
- Support targeted marketing strategies based on data-driven insights.
  
## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn: PCA, KMeans, StandardScaler
- Jupyter Notebook
- HTML: for documenting and sharing results

## ⚙️ Workflow Summary
- Data Loading
- Import population and customer datasets.
- Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values and convert symbolic codes to NaN.
- Feature Engineering
- Encode categorical features and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Clustering
- Use K-Means to identify distinct demographic segments.
- Comparison
- Analyze customer representation across clusters.
  
## 📈 Key Results
